# Responsive-Navbar-and-Pricing-Page-with-Flexbox
This project is a responsive webpage featuring a navigation bar and a pricing plan section. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a mobile-friendly design, employing Flexbox for layout alignment and media queries for responsiveness. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key features and functionalities implemented in this project.

Features

1. Responsive Navbar with Dropdown
The navigation bar contains links to different sections of the page: Home, About, Services, and Contact.
A "Get Started" button is included for users to take action.
On smaller screens, the navbar transforms into a hamburger menu (<i class="fa-solid fa-bars"></i>) for a clean and user-friendly mobile experience.
A dropdown menu appears when the toggle button is clicked, and the icon changes from a hamburger to a close icon (<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i>), enhancing the user interaction.
2. Pricing Plans Section
Three pricing plans (Basic, Standard, and Premium) are displayed with details such as price and features.
Flexbox is used to evenly distribute the pricing plans across the screen and center them both horizontally and vertically for a balanced layout.
Each pricing plan has a "Sign Up" button styled to attract attention.
3. Background and Visual Elements
The page features a background image that is centered and covers the entire screen, creating a visually engaging backdrop.
The background remains fixed during scrolling, offering a modern look.
Colors and hover effects are used to enhance user interaction. For instance, buttons change size slightly when hovered to simulate a 3D effect.
4. Mobile-First Design
The layout is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using media queries.
For screens narrower than 992px, the navigation links and "Get Started" button are hidden, and the toggle button is displayed.
For screens narrower than 576px, the pricing plans stack vertically with appropriate padding and margins to ensure they remain legible and visually appealing.
Technologies Used

HTML5: Used to structure the page, with semantic elements for better readability.
CSS3: Applied for the styling, with a focus on Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
Font Awesome: Utilized for icons in the navigation bar toggle button.
Google Fonts: "Sono" and "Open Sans" fonts are used for modern typography.
